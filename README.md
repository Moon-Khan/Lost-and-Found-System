# LOST AND FOUND

A lost and found system for a university in web development is a platform or application that helps students, faculty, and staff to report lost items and recover them if found. It is typically used by universities, colleges, and other educational institutions where students and faculty members may misplace their belongings.

The system allows users to report lost items through an online form, which includes details about the item, the location where it was lost, and the contact information of the person who lost it. The system then stores this information in a database and notifies users if their lost item has been found.
